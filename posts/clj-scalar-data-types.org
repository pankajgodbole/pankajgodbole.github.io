* Definition
  - A scalar datatype is a datatype which represents a single value.
  - Clojure supports the following datatypes:
    1. characters
    2. character strings
    3. numbers
    4. keywords
    5. symbols
  - Clojure is a hosted language and is closely knit with its host, Java. This means that the semantics of some of the scalar datatypes are based on those of their Java counterparts.
