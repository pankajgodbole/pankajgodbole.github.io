<p>
In the previous article, we learnt in-depth what symbolic programming is, and saw that macros are a natural consequence of it. The present article is the first of a three-part series of articles in which we shall take a close look at what macros are, and learn how, and more importantly, when to use them in Clojure.

<h2 id="org65e6524">Symbolic Programming - a recap</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org65e6524">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Non-symbolic computation means the manipulation of concrete values, whereas symbolic computation means the manipulation of the symbols that name the concrete values and of the expressions involving symbols (symbolic expressions).</li>
<li>In symbolic programming or computating, the programmer can write code that processes individual symbols or symbolic expressions just as well as he or she could write code that processes other types of data such as numbers, characters or strings.</li>
<li>Thus, a symbolic program is able to even manipulate its own code as if it were just another type of data.</li>
<li>Programming using symbols is an abstraction over programming using raw values.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8aef999">
<p>
The ability of a program to manipulate its own source code leads to some interesting possibilities. A program with such capability may now add new code to itself, or modify itself in other ways, and the compiler would proceed to compile the modified program as usual to produce new effects. Such a program is called a <i>macro</i> in symbolic programming languages.
A macro is processed in two steps: first, the macro code is executed and the result is spliced back into the program. Next, the modified program is evaluated as if it were a regular program. The first step is called <i>macro expansion</i> and the second step is called <i>evaluation</i>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfd72096">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A macro is similar to a function, but a macro never evaluates its arguments before executing its body unlike a function which always first evaluates its arguments. The programmer may choose to evaluate the arguments in the body of the macro if needed by the program.</li>
<li>Macro code makes use of the symbolic programming functions and special operators, namely, <code>eval</code>, <code>'</code>, <code>`</code> and <code>~</code>.</li>

<h2 id="org08ee986">Uses of macros</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org08ee986">
<p>
  When used properly, macros are a very powerful feature of a language. By enabling the building of new functionality "on the top of" existing functionality, they help to extend the capability of the language.
When one programs in a particular domain, one sometimes finds that certain functions, techniques or even representations of data repeat themselves. If such recurring patterns could be abstracted away, then the code would be more direct and syntactically better suited to the domain. At other times one could benefit from a language feature that would make the program clearer and more concise for just a single instance.
  In a language that doesn't support macros, the feature-set of a language is, more or less, "baked into" the language by the language designers. Any new syntactic and semantic feature may only be added by the designers themselves, usually after a lengthy debate, and often only if they deem the feature to be appropriate and necessary for the language as a whole. In a language supporting macros, however, the programmer could immediately write a macro to make the code more succint, or write a set of macros to abstract away the common parts of any recurring coding pattern, and continue with his or her actual task.
  In the next article, we shall learn when and how to write macros. In the third article we shall study a few common macros in Clojure.

<h2 id="orgab87871">What is Symbolic Programming?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgab87871">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Symbolic programming</i> or <i>symbolic computating</i> is a programming paradigm in which the program treats itself or other similar code as plain data.</li>
<li>A symbolic program can manipulate is own code as if it were plain data.</li>
<li>Such a program has functions on expressions as well as having functions on numbers, strings, characters, bits and other types of data.</li>
<li>Thus, a symbolic program can produce new code and evaluate the new code to produce other results.</li>
<li>In symbolic programming it is easy to create complex data structures such as lists, trees and maps.</li>
<li>Symbolic programming is supported by Lisps (Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, etc) and by the logic programming language Prolog.</li>
<li>The expressions in a symbolic programming language are called <i>symbolic expressions</i> or <i>s-expressions</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="orgbce50ef">Symbolic vs Numeric Computing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbce50ef">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The method of programming where data are manipulated is called <i>numeric programming</i> or <i>numeric computation</i>.</li>
<li>Symbolic computation is computing with symbols, whereas numeric computation is computing with numbers.</li>
<li>If we were to compare computer programming with mathematics we might say that numeric computing is akin to arithmetics while symbolic computating is akin to algrebra.</li>
<li>Thus, symbolic programming is an abstraction over numeric programming, just as algrebra is over plain arithmetics.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="orgfc07696"><code>eval</code> function</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfc07696">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In a symbolic program it is essential to be able to evaluate the code that is produced by a symbolic program.</li>
<li>This is made possible in Clojure by the <code>eval</code> function which simply evaluates its argument.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org13f8a50" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org13f8a50"><code>quote</code> Function and the <code>'</code> special form</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org13f8a50">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In Clojure (as in Lisps in general and in some other languages) every symbol and expression, including the argument to a function, is evaluated as soon as it is read.</li>
<li>So, if the reader encounters a symbol it does not recognize, it will complain about it. What if we want to use a symbol as itself, rather than any value it names?</li>
<li>Clojure being a symbolic programming language provides a function, <code>quote</code> which simply returns its argument verbatim.</li>
<li><code>quote</code> is the opposite of <code>eval</code> which always evaluates its argument.</li>
<li>By using the function <code>quote</code>, one can prevent an s-expression from being evaluated and its value being returned, and instead access the s-expression itself.</li>
<li>This operation is called <i>quoting</i> and is so common in symbolic programming that is has its own special operator <code>'</code>.</li>
<li><code>quote</code> is a <i>special form</i> because it does not evaluate its argument unlike a regular function which always first evaluates its argument.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org159f397" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org159f397">Backquote special form</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org159f397">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While quoting is essential and very useful, sometimes it is meaningful to first evaluate an s-expression or a part of it before quoting the result.</li>
<li>This is possible via the backquote special form (written as <code>`</code>)</li>
<li>The <code>`</code> special form extends the functionality the familiar <code>'</code> special form, in that it enables the programer to mark an expression to evaluate.</li>
<li>The special operator <code>~</code> (pronounced "unquote") is used to mark the part of the expression to evaluate.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The example given below illustrates succinctly how to use <code>eval</code>, <code>'</code>, <code>`</code> and <code>~</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">;; quote, eval, backquote and unquote

(let [b "kingfisher"]
  [b 'b (eval b) `~b])
;; ["kingfisher" b "kingfisher" "kingfisher"]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A natural product of symbolic programming using <code>eval</code>, <code>'</code>, <code>`</code> and <code>~</code> are macros.

<h3 id="org1f2cd77">What is a macro?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1f2cd77">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A macro is similar to a function, with one major difference: a macro never evaluates its arguments before executing its body unlike a function which always first evaluates its arguments.</li>
<li>The programmer chooses whether or not to evaluate the macro arguments in the body of the macro.</li>
<li>Macro code makes use of the symbolic programming functions and special operators, namely, <code>eval</code>, <code>'</code>, <code>`</code> and <code>~</code>.</li>
<li>Macros provide a means of abstracting over the common parts of any recurring coding pattern in a language, and thus help to extend the feature-set of the language.</li>
<li>A macro is processed in two steps:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Macro expansion</i> - First, the macro code is executed and the result is spliced back into the program.</li>
<li><i>Evaluation</i>      - Finally, the program modified with the expanded macro code is evaluated as if it were a regular program.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

In the next article we shall take in close look at macros and how and when to use them in Clojure.
